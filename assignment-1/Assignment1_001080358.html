            <li>Apply for an original Social Security card</li>

    <p><font size="3.5"><b>IMPORTANT : </b></font>You MUST provide a properly completed application and the required evidence before we can process your application. We can only accept original documents or documents certified by the custodian of the original record. Notarized copies or photocopies which have not been certified by the custodian of the record are not acceptable. We will return any documents submitted with your application. For assistance call us at 1-800-772-1213 or visit our website at <a href="https://www.socialsecurity.gov">www.socialsecurity.gov</a>.</p>

    <h3>Original Social Security Card</h3>
    <p>
        To apply for an original card, you must provide at least two documents to prove age, identity, and U.S. citizenship or current lawful, work-authorized immigration status. If you are not a U.S. citizen and do not have DHS work authorization, you must prove that you have a valid non-work reason for requesting a card. See page 2 for an explanation of acceptable documents.
    </p>
    <span>
        NOTE: If you are age 12 or older and have never received a Social Security number, you must apply in person.
    </span>

    <h3>Replacement Social Security Card</h3>
    <p>To apply for a replacement card, you must provide one document to prove your identity. If you were born outside the U.S., you must also provide documents to prove your U.S. citizenship or current, lawful, work- authorized status. See page 2 for an explanation of acceptable documents.</p>

    <h3>Replacement Social Security Card</h3>
    <p>To change the information on your Social Security number record (i.e., a name or citizenship change, or
        corrected date of birth) you must provide documents to prove your identity, support the requested change, and establish the reason for the change. For example, you may provide a birth certificate to show your correct date of birth. A document supporting a name change must be recent and identify you by both your old and new names. If the name change event occurred over two years ago or if the name change document does not have enough information to prove your identity, you must also provide documents to prove your identity in your prior name and/or in some cases your new legal name. If you were born outside the U.S. you must provide a document to prove your U.S. citizenship or current lawful, work-authorized status. See page 2 for an explanation of acceptable documents.
    </p>

    <h3 align="center"><u>LIMITS ON REPLACEMENT SOCIAL SECURITY CARDS</u></h3>
    <p>Public Law 108-458 limits the number of replacement Social Security cards you may receive to 3 per calendar year and 10 in a lifetime. Cards issued to reflect changes to your legal name or changes to a work authorization legend do not count toward these limits. We may also grant exceptions to these limits if you provide evidence from an official source to establish that a Social Security card is required.</p>

    <h3 align="center"><u>IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS</u></h3>
    <p>If you have any questions about this form or about the evidence documents you must provide, please visit our website at <a href="https://www.socialsecurity.gov">www.socialsecurity.gov</a> for additional information as well as locations of our offices and Social Security Card Centers. You may also call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213. You can also find your nearest office or Card Center in your local phone book.</p>

    <h3 align="center">EVIDENCE DOCUMENTS</h3>
    <p>The following lists are examples of the types of documents you must provide with your application and are not all inclusive. Call us at 1-800-772-1213 if you cannot provide these documents.</p>
    <p><font size="3.5"><b>IMPORTANT : </b></font>If you are completing this application on behalf of someone else, you must provide evidence that shows your authority to sign the application as well as documents to prove your identity and the identity of the person for whom you are filing the application. We can only accept original documents or documents certified by the custodian of the original record. Notarized copies or photocopies which have not been certified by the custodian of the record are not acceptable.</p>

    <h3>Evidence of Age</h3>
    <p>In general, you must provide your birth certificate. In some situations, we may accept another document that shows your age. Some of the other documents we may accept are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>U.S. hospital record of your birth (created at the time of birth)</li>
        <li>Religious record established before age five showing your age or date of birth</li>
        <li>Passport</li>
        <li>Final Adoption Decree (the adoption decree must show that the birth information was taken from the original birth certificate)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Evidence of Identity</h3>
    <p>You must provide current, unexpired evidence of identity in your legal name. Your legal name will be shown on
        the Social Security card. Generally, we prefer to see documents issued in the U.S. Documents you submit to establish identity must show your legal name AND provide biographical information (your date of birth, age, or parents' names) <b><u>and/or</u></b> physical information (photograph, or physical description - height, eye and hair color, etc.). If you send a photo identity document but do not appear in person, the document must show your biographical information (e.g., your date of birth, age, or parents' names). Generally, documents without an expiration date should have been issued within the past two years for adults and within the past four years for children.
    </p>

    <p>As proof of your identity, you must provide a:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>U.S. driver's license; or</li>
        <li>U.S. State-issued non-driver identity card; or</li>
        <li>U.S. passport</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you do not have one of the documents above or cannot get a replacement within 10 work days, we may accept other documents that show your legal name and biographical information, such as a U.S. military identity card, Certificate of Naturalization, employee identity card, certified copy of medical record (clinic, doctor or hospital), health insurance card, Medicaid card, or school identity card/record. For young children, we may accept medical records (clinic, doctor, or hospital) maintained by the medical provider. We may also accept a final adoption decree, or a school identity card, or other school record maintained by the school.</p>
    <p>If you are not a U.S. citizen, we must see your current U.S. immigration document(s) and your foreign passport with biographical information or photograph.</p>
    <p>WE CANNOT ACCEPT A BIRTH CERTIFICATE, HOSPITAL SOUVENIR BIRTH CERTIFICATE, SOCIAL
        SECURITY CARD STUB OR A SOCIAL SECURITY RECORD as evidence of identity.
    </p>

    <h3>Evidence of U.S. Citizenship</h3>
    <p>In general, you must provide your U.S. birth certificate or U.S. Passport. Other documents you may provide are a Consular Report of Birth, Certificate of Citizenship, or Certificate of Naturalization.</p>

    <h3>Evidence of Immigration Status</h3>
    <p>You must provide a current unexpired document issued to you by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
        showing your immigration status, such as Form I-551, I-94, or I-766. If you are an international student or exchange visitor, you may need to provide additional documents, such as Form I-20, DS-2019, or a letter authorizing employment from your school and employer (F-1) or sponsor (J-1). We CANNOT accept a receipt showing you applied for the document. If you are not authorized to work in the U.S., we can issue you a Social Security card only if you need the number for a valid non-work reason. Your card will be marked to show you cannot work and if you do work, we will notify DHS. See page 3, item 5 for more information.

    <h3 align="center"><b><u>PROTECT YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND CARD</u></b></h3>
    <p>Protect your SSN card and number from loss and identity theft. DO NOT carry your SSN card with you. Keep it in a secure location and only take it with you when you must show the card; e.g., to obtain a new job, open a new bank account, or to obtain benefits from certain U.S. agencies. Use caution in giving out your Social Security number to others, particularly during phone, mail, email and Internet requests you did not initiate.</p>

        <h2 align="center">PRIVACY ACT STATEMENT</h2>
        <h2 align="center">Collection and Use of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>Sections 205(c) and 702 of the Social Security Act, as amended, authorize us to collect this information. The information you provide will be used to assign you a Social Security number and issue a Social Security card.</p>
        <p>The information you furnish on this form is voluntary. However, failure to provide the requested information may prevent us from issuing you a Social Security number and card.</p>
        <p>We rarely use the information you supply for any purpose other than for issuing a Social Security number and card. However, we may use it for the administration and integrity of Social Security programs. We may also disclose information to another person or to another agency in accordance with approved routine uses, which include but are not limited to the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To enable a third party or an agency to assist Social Security in establishing rights to Social Security benefits and/or coverage;</li>
            <li>To comply with Federal laws requiring the release of information from Social Security records (e.g., to the Government Accountability Office and Department of Veterans' Affairs);</li>
            <li>To make determinations for eligibility in similar health and income maintenance programs at the Federal, State, and local level; and</li>
            <li>To facilitate statistical research, audit or investigative activities necessary to assure the integrity of Social Security programs.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We may also use the information you provide in computer matching programs. Matching programs compare our records with records kept by other Federal, State, or local government agencies.
            Information from these matching programs can be used to establish or verify a person's eligibility for Federally-funded or administered benefit programs and for repayment of payments or delinquent debts under these programs.
        </p>
        <p>Complete lists of routine uses for this information are available in System of Records Notice 60-0058 (Master Files of Social Security Number (SSN) Holders and SSN Applications).
