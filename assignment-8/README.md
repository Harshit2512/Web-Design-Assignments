**Project Title : Web Design User Experience Assignment8**
- This assignment is created as part of course curriculum under INFO6150 course and basically concentrate on Node JS. It is to demonstrate the building application using Node JS with Mongo DB as data storage platform using REST API.

**Description of files**
- This project has server.js file and a api folder which includes other required JS files for implementing MVC framework.
- server. js is used to initialize all required libraries such as body parser, mongo db and express js.
- app.js file with api folder is used to intialize route and model for MVC architecture.
- api folder contains files each for model, route, service and controller.
- There is a .gitignore file which excludes .log files and other system generated files and npm dependencies from commit.
- GitHub has been used for code saving and version controlling as code management tool.
- GitHub has two branches where develop branch has commits during development and final code has been merged in master branch.

**Prerequisites**
- Postman tool is used to test REST API functionality.
- This application has been developed using Visual Code Studio, Google Chrome browser and postman for API testing.

**Installation**
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/neu-mis-info6150-fall-2019/assignment-8-Harshit2512.git'.
2. Navigate to project directory `cd assignment-8-Harshit2512`.
3. Run `npm install --save express body-parser mongoose` to install libraries.


**Build**
1. To build the app, run `npm run build`.

**Running the code**
- After starting application, MVC functionality can be tested by using various HTTP requests through postman tool and data can seen in mongo DB.
- By default application is set to run on port 4000 and can be accessed with URL http://localhost:4000/items
  
**Versioning**
